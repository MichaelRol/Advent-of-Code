# Advent of Code
A repository for holding my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. More info: [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

Each year is written in a different programming language and all solutions are designed to complete within 15 seconds on relatively basic hardware. 

2022 is written in Rust. This was my first attempt at using the Rust programming language.

2021 is written in Swift. This was my first attempt at using the Swift programming language.

2020 is written in Go. This was my first attempt at using the Go programming language. 

2019 is written in Java.
