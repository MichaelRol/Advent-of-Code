# Advent of Code 2020
A repository for holding my solutions to the 2020 Advent of Code challenges. More info: [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

All my solutions are written in the Go programming language and are designed to complete within 15 seconds on relatively basic hardware. This was my first attempt at using the Go programming language. 

## Running Challenges

All challenges can be run using

```console
$ go run Day[Day number]-[1|2].go
```
