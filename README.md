# Advent of Code
A repository for holding my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. More info: [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

Each year is written in a different programming language, and all solutions are designed to be completed within 15 seconds on relatively basic hardware. 

2024 is written in Typescript. I have written a fair amount of Typescript this year, but I plan to use this opportunity to become more idiomatic. 

2023 is written in Java. I have decided to take a year off from abusing myself. 

2022 is written in Rust. This was my first attempt at using the Rust programming language.

2021 is written in Swift. This was my first attempt at using the Swift programming language.

2020 is written in Go. This was my first attempt at using the Go programming language. 

2019 is written in Java.

## Running Challenges

2024 challenges can be run using

```console
$ ts-node run [Day number] [Part number]
or
$ ts-node run [Day number]
to run both parts of a single day
ts-node run
to run all problems
can also replace "run" with "test" to run the test cases
```

2022 challenges can be run using

```console
$ cargo run [Day number] [Part number]
or
$ cargo run
to run all problems
```
from the `2022/aoc2022` folder

2021 challenges can be run using

```console
$ swift run AOC2021 [Day number] [Part number]
```

2020 challenges can be run using

from each parts subfolder.
