# Advent of Code
A repository for holding my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. More info: [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

Each year is written in a different programming language and all solutions are designed to complete within 15 seconds on relatively basic hardware. 

2020 is written in Go. This was my first attempt at using the Go programming language. 

2019 is written in Java.

## Running Challenges

2020 challenges can be run using

```console
$ go run Day[Day number]-[1|2].go
```

2019 challenges can be run by importing the files into an suitable Java IDE (e.g. Eclipse).
